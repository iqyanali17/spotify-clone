🎵 Spotify Web Player Clone
A responsive front-end clone of the Spotify Web Player. This project replicates the Spotify desktop interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — including UI components like sidebar, music player controls, search bar, and interactive features like song progress and play/pause functionality.


🚀 Features
🎨 Fully styled UI with Montserrat font and Font Awesome icons

🧭 Sticky navigation bar with forward/backward controls

🧱 Sidebar with Home, Search, and Your Library

🧩 Cards section: Recently Played, Trending Near You, Featured Charts

🎧 Interactive bottom music player:

Play/Pause button

Progress bar with current and total duration

Volume control (hidden on small screens)

🖥 Responsive layout for desktop and smaller screens


📦 Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the page

CSS3: Styling with Flexbox and media queries

JavaScript (ES6): Handling audio control and UI interaction

Font Awesome: Icon set for music controls and navigation

Google Fonts: Montserrat font for modern UI look

📝 Notes
This is a front-end only clone. No actual music library, authentication, or backend services are implemented.

The music player currently plays a single hardcoded song (Daylight by David Kushner).

The project is made for educational and learning purposes only and is not affiliated with Spotify.
